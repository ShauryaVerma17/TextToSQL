## Contents of this POC

This initial POC is to understand the basic working of the Vanna library. 

## Vanna Configuration in this POC'

A lot of the things used in this POC are the defaults that Vanna already use, hence not a lot of configuration is required which is perfect for an intial POC.

### LLM 

The default LLM i.e. GPT-3.5 is used.

### VectorDB

The defualy VectorDB i.e. pgvector is used.

### SQL DB

I am using SQLite3 just as it is easy to call in python. I am using a popular template DB called Chinook for testing. The schema diagram of the DB is in the folder as well for understanding.
